# Test Module

This Verilog project is based on the VGA project that came with the RZ EasyFPGA board, but adds tests for LEDs, the buzzer, and the seven segment LED displays.

The standard start puts out a pattern on the VGA port.

Pressing the third button lights up two LEDs and plays the buzzer.  Pressing the fourth button at the same time as the third button lights up the other two LEDs and turns off the first two.
